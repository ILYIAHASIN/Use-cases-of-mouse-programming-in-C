In this C program, we have demonstrated how to control the mouse using functions to get the current mouse position, move the mouse cursor, click the left and right mouse buttons, and scroll the mouse wheel. By utilizing Windows API functions, we can interact with the mouse programmatically, enabling automation of mouse-related tasks. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs for mouse control in C programming.
